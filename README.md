## 🎯 What is Multi-PDF Chatbot?

**Multi-PDF Chatbot** is a production-grade intelligent document assistant built on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It enables natural language conversations across multiple PDF documents simultaneously — all running **locally on your machine** with zero cloud dependency, zero data leakage.

Whether you're analyzing research papers, legal contracts, financial reports, or technical manuals — this system extracts knowledge and answers your questions with precision using state-of-the-art local LLMs.

## 🖥️ Live Demo

### 📌 Application Interface
The full-stack chatbot UI built with Streamlit — sleek, dark-themed, and intuitive.

![Application Screenshot](img/LLMframework.png)

> *Upload multiple PDF files via the sidebar → Ask your question in natural language → Receive detailed, evidence-based answers from your local LLM.*

<br/>

### 🔬 Real-World Test: CALM Paper Analysis
Uploaded and queried the **"Compositionality by Abstraction (CALM)"** research paper from arXiv. The model accurately synthesized the paper's core contribution — the CALM framework for composing anchor and augmenting LLMs.

> *Asked: "talk about this book's purpose in detail" — RAG retrieved the most relevant chunks and the LLM delivered a structured, accurate response about the CALM framework.*

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the complete **RAG pipeline** — from raw PDF input to final AI-generated answer.

### ⚙️ How it Works — Step by Step

| Step | Stage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 📄 **Document Ingestion** | User uploads one or more PDF files via the Streamlit sidebar |
| **2** | ✂️ **Text Chunking** | Documents are split into overlapping chunks (5,000 chars / 1,000 overlap) using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` |
| **3** | 🔢 **Embedding Generation** | Each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector using `qwen3-embedding` via Ollama |
| **4** | 🗄️ **Vector Store (FAISS)** | Embeddings are indexed locally in a FAISS vector database for millisecond-speed semantic retrieval |
| **5** | ❓ **Query Processing** | User's question is embedded using the same model to preserve semantic consistency |
| **6** | 🔍 **Semantic Search** | FAISS performs similarity search and retrieves the top-k most relevant chunks |
| **7** | 🤖 **LLM Generation** | Retrieved context + question is fed to `llama3.1:8b` via Ollama for final answer synthesis |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

<div align="center">

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Interactive web UI with dark mode |
| **Orchestration** | LangChain | Pipeline management, prompting, QA chain |
| **LLM Inference** | Ollama + `llama3.1:8b` | Local, private language model serving |
| **Embeddings** | Ollama + `qwen3-embedding` | Semantic vector representations |
| **Vector Search** | FAISS | Ultra-fast local similarity retrieval |
| **PDF Parsing** | PyPDF2 | Multi-page text extraction |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.9+
Ollama (Desktop or Server runtime)
```

<br/>

### 1️⃣ Clone & Set Up Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MultiPDF_RAG.git
cd MultiPDF_RAG

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Pull Local LLM Models via Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com then:
ollama pull llama3.1:8b        # Chat / reasoning model
ollama pull qwen3-embedding    # Embedding model
```

### 4️⃣ Launch the Application

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run chatapp.py
```

The app opens automatically at `http://localhost:8501` 🎉

<br/>

## 📖 Usage Guide

```
1. Launch the app with the command above
2. In the LEFT SIDEBAR — upload one or more PDF files
3. Click [Submit & Process] and wait for the ✅ Done confirmation
4. In the MAIN PANEL — type any natural language question
5. Read the AI-generated, context-grounded answer
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Ask specific, targeted questions for best results. The RAG system retrieves the most semantically relevant passages before generating an answer.
